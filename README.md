#French dev
As long as i made this mod for my personnal use, there is a lot of french stuff in it. 
For instance, hero caracteristics are written in french : Physique = Strengh, Logique = Logic, and Mental = Moral resilience.

#How it works
Each player has to set each caracteristics by using :
- /physique set [1-95]
- /mental set [1-95]
- /logique set [1-95]
If it's not done, player will be able to roll dice but not to roll caracteristic.

Then it requires for the player to be his turn. Using the "My turn" tool item to be set as "current player".

Then player can roll a dice using appropriate tool item dice (d3 d5 d7 d9 d10 or d100).
To roll multiple dice in same time, you need to stack items. For instance to roll 2d10 stack 2 dice10 then right click.

Then use the "physique", "mental" or "logique" item to test it.
If a player get from GM a bonus or a malus he must do /modifier [value].

When a dice is rolled or a modifier is set, those informations are displayed on screen on top right corner.
